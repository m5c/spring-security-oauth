# Spring Security OAuth2 Samples

A minimal sample setup that
reflects [OAuth2 service access delegation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) for
service
administrators and users.

## About

OAuth2 is a security protocol to delegate access for a secured REST API. This repository contains a
well documented and explained sample setup for access delegation on behalf of service administrators
and service users.

### Origins

The code in this repository is based on one
of [Baeldung's Spring-Security sample projects](https://github.com/Baeldung/spring-security-oauth/tree/master/oauth-authorization-server),
namely the "oauth-authorization-server" project. For more details on Baeldungs original tutorial,
see: [Baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-oauth-auth-server).

### OAuth2 Protocol

Purpose of OAuth2 is to authorize a third party service (named *Client*) to access secured
endpoints of an existing API (*Resource Server*).
The interest of OAuth2 is to enable a secure access, without requiring the original API user (*Resource Owner*) to share their credentials with the *Client*. This is achieved by means of
cryptographic tokens issued by an additional service (*Authorization Server*).

As such, the key entities in any OAuth2 interplay are the following three RESTful services:

* A **Resource Server**: Offers a resource, belonging to a *Resource Owner*. The latter is
  usually a biological or legal person.
* A **Client**: Requests to access a protected resource of the *Resource Server*, to perform actions
  on behalf of the *Resource Owner*.
* An **Authorization Server**: Center part of the OAuth2 protocol and provider of secure
  tokens to allow impersonation of the *Resource Owner* by the *Client*.

The *Authorization Server* is often a preexisting entity, e.g. a service provided by an established
tech company. For educative purposes and to maintain versatility this project brings it's own
off-the-shelf implementation.

#### Communication Layout

The effective OAuth2 communication layout varies, depending on how roles are separated or fused:

* In essence, these variants differ in *how the granted authorization* is transferred back from
  **Authorization Server** to **Client**.
* The above process of transferring the authorization is called [*Authorization Grant
  *](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3) in protocol jargon.
* There are different *Authorization Grant* types, but here we only deal with the standard case:
    * Parties place minimal trust in one another.
    * Parties are fully separated executables (services).
* This standard type is called [*Authorization Code
  Grant*](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1), in protocol jargon.

Below schema illustrates the communication flow for the standard **Authorization Code** type:

```
     +--------+                               +---------------+
     |        |--(A)- Authorization Request ->|   Resource    |
     |        |     (is a redirect to AS)     |     Owner     |
     |        |<------------------------------|               |
     |        | (B.3) RO forwards Auth. Code) +---------------+
     |        |                                  ^   ^
     |        |            (B.1) Page Forward    |   |  (B.2) RO grants auth.
     |        |             & grant form reply   v   v   & AS returns Auth. Code
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |--(C)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
     | Client |                               |     Server    |
     |        |<-(D)----- Access Token -------|               |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |--(E)----- Access Token ------>|    Resource   |
     |        |                               |     Server    |
     |        |<-(F)--- Protected Resource ---|               |
     +--------+                               +---------------+
```

## Context

This repository reflects the [standard protocol entities](#oauth2-protocol). However, instead of a
single *Client*, the repo contains two, to better illustrate the two most prominent use cases of
access delegation with OAuth2:

### Authorization Scenarios

1) Delegation of *Resource Server* API access on behalf of a service *Administrator*. The *Resource
   Owner* is an administrator of the *Resource Server*.  
   Here the *Resource Server* is accessed by a *Client*, who wishes to access a REST
   endpoint intended for administrators, and therefore likewise requires authorization by a
   *Resource Server* administrator.
2) Delegation of *Resource Server* API access on behalf of a service *User*. The *Resource
   Owner* is a user of the *Resource Server*.  
   Here the *Resource Server* is accessed by a *Client*, who wishes to access a REST
   endpoint intended for their personal use. Therefore, this access likewise requires authorization
   by the exact same *Resource Server* user.

### Service Entities

This repository contains the following four services:

* [**Resource Server**](resource-server): A slightly modified version
  of [the BookStore](https://github.com/m5c/BookStoreInternals). The relatively small API has been
  secured, to allow for OAuth2 secured access of selected REST endpoints.
* [**Authorization Server**](spring-authorization-server): A mostly off the shelf implementation of
  Springs default OAuth2 *Authorization Server*.
* [**Admin Client (Assortment Extender)**](assortment-client-server): A first OAuth2 *Client*, which
  uses the OAuth2
  protocol to request access, and subsequently modify the bookstore's assortment. Note that this
  catalogue of all indexed books is considered under the governance of a *Resource Service*
  administrator.
* [**User Client (Stock Replenisher)**](stock-client-server): A second OAuth2 *Client*, which uses
  the OAuth2
  protocol to request access, and subsequently modify a local store's stock (amount of copies in
  store). The corresponding resource is considered under the governance of a local store manager
  user, who grants access to the selected REST resource of the **Resource Server** on their behalf.

Illustration of the secured access:

* The right side illustrates the REST resources and access points of the modified bookstore. Circles
  with thicker stroke indicate REST methods that are access protected.
* The clients on the left each request access to one respective protected resource using the OAuth2
  protocol. Subsequently, these services interact with the bookstore on behalf of the grantee.
    * **Client 1**: *Assortment Extender* is granted access to the **[PUT]** operation on
      resource `/bookstore/isbns/{isbn}`, which allows adding new books to the global assortment.
      This resource is considered owned by an *administrator* of the *Resource Server*. Therefore,
      access is denied unless the *Resource Owner* is in the `ADMIN` group.
    * **Client 2**: *Stock Replenisher* is granted access to the **[POST]** operation on
      resource `/bookstore/stocklocations/{location}/{isbn}`, which allows changing the amount of
      copies in store for a given book and location. This resource is considered owned by an
      *standard user* of the *Resource Server*, who is in charge of a corresponding store.
      Therefore, access is denied unless the *Resource Owner*'s name matches the `{location}` URL
      parameter.

## Technical Details

Several changes were made, with respect to
the [original Baeldung example](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-oauth-auth-server):
The main difference is that the referenced OAuth2 example showcases no notion for user-owned
resources, and hence matching of resource and username. Likewise, the original configuration does
not verify user roles, to
ensure access is matched against user privileges.

Several changes were necessary, to implement these standard usecases:

* The original *Resource Server* was replaced by
  the [BookStore](https://github.com/m5c/BookStoreInternals), to provide a minimum of API complexity
  and legit context for the two types of access delegation: *Service-User* access delegation and
  *Service-Admin* access delegation.
* One protected resource has been configured to use Spring's expression language (SpEL), to
  crosscheck a URL parameter of the resource against their username. This scenario is indicated by
  mappings between *red* markers in the figure above.
    * The access protection takes place [in the *Resource Server*, and uses a ```@PreAuthorize```
      annotation](resource-server/src/main/java/com/baeldung/web/GlobalStockController.java).
* A second protected resource has been configured to require an *Administrator* role of the
  authorizing user. This second scenario is indicated by mappings between *blue* markers in the
  figure above.  
  This second scenario required several technical changes:
    * By default, details on the authorizing user (*Resource Owner*) and accessing *Client* are
      transmitted by means of a signed `Json Web Token`. The token is used by the *Client* while
      accessing a
      protected method at the *Resource Server*. Token details did not contain information on the
      *Resource Owner*'s group affiliation (administrator or standard user). Therefore, the [
      *Authorization Server*](spring-authorization-server) issuing this token has been reconfigured
      to contain this information in the token.
    * Likewise the receiving end does not readily consider the additional token information (also
      called *claim*) for interpretation, and subsequent access rules. Therefore, the *Resource
      Server* [has been configured to extract and interpret the additional token claim](resource-server/src/main/java/com/baeldung/config/FusedClaimConverter.java).
    * Finally the *Resource Server* has been [configured to actually use the transmitted grantee
      group information, to decide on accept / reject of incoming requests](resource-server/src/main/java/com/baeldung/web/AssortmentController.java)
      from the OAuth2 *Client*.

## Run Instructions

This section explains how to start up the sample micro service, test correct execution of the
protocol and access protection.

### Preliminaries

Before you start up any service, add the following entry to you `/etc/hosts` file:  
`127.0.0.1 auth-server`

This allows refering to the *Authorization Server* by domain name, which is needed because otherwise
all services are resolved localhost and associated session cookies override another.

### Service Startup

The four aforementioned services must be launched in the following order:

1) **Authorization Server**
2) **Resource Server**
3) Both **Client**s: Assortment Extender, Stock Replenisher

Use the same launch command for every service, from the respective root
directory: `mvn spring-bookt:run`

### Testing Anonymous Access

The BookStore runs on port `8090`, so we can use any HTTP client to test access.
For convenience this repo hosts [a prepared ARC file](sample-queries.arc), for easy testing of
sample queries with the [Advanced Rest Client](https://www.advancedrestclient.com).

Alternatively these `curl` command allow quick testing of selected endpoints of the BookStore API:

* Get list of all books in assortment:  
  `curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8090/bookstore/isbns`
* Look up amount of Harry Potter books in Lyon store:  
  `curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8090/bookstore/stocklocations/Lyon/9780739360385`

The above commands are not access restricted and must return valid backend data.

Next you can attempt direct anonymous access to the two secured endpoints: Both must fail with
return code `403 Forbidden`, for the below curl commands do not contain an OAuth2 token:

* Attempt to add a new book to the assortment:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8090/bookstore/isbns/3518368540 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
   \"isbn\":3518368540,
   \"title\":\"Homo Faber\",
   \"author\":\"Max Frisch\",
   \"priceInCents\":1610,
   \"bookAbstract\":\"Max Frischs 1957 novel \"Homo faber\" describes people in the technological age who believe they can organize life according to the laws of logic and science. According to Frisch, modern man lives past himself and surrenders to the feasibility euphoria of technology.\"
   }"
```

* Attempt to change to amount of Harry Potter copies in the Lyon store:

```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/bookstore/stocklocations/Lyon/9780739360385 \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d "1000"
```

### Testing Authorized Access

The *Client*s are configures to run through the OAuth2 dance, when first requested to perform a
delegated operation. In both cases they act as proxies, that is to say when a certain of their
respective endpoints is accessed, this triggers request for authoriation and subsequent BookStore
API access.

More precisely, this is how you can test each *Client*:

* **Assortment Extender**: Access the one and only REST
  endpoint: [```[GET] http://127.0.0.1:8080/assortmentextension```](http://127.0.0.1:8080/assortmentextension)
  with your browser.
    * The *Client* will internally try to attempt an invocation of the *Resource Server*'s protected
      endpoint: ```[PUT] http://127.0.0.1:8090/bookstore/isbns/3518368540```
    * However, the *Client* is also configured to first obtain clearance for direct access. This is
      why
      it triggers the OAuth2 dance and forwards your browser to the *Authorization Server*'s login
      page.
    * Login with the credentials ```AssortmentExtender``` / ```password```.
    * You will be redirected to the *Client*s proxy endpoint, the *Client* internally performs the
      delegate call and returns the result.
    * The *Resource Server*, upon receipt of the *Client's* JWT, [ensures the grantee is a *Resource
      Server* admin](resource-server/src/main/java/com/baeldung/web/AssortmentController.java), and
      grants access.
    * The returned list of isbn numbers now contains an additional entry, `3518368540`, which
      represents the newly added book.

* **Stock Replenisher**: Access the one and only REST
  endpoint: [```[GET] http://127.0.0.1:8081/stockextension/lyon/```](http://127.0.0.1:8081/stockextension/lyon/)
  with your browser.
    * The *Client* will internally try to attempt an invocation of the *Resource Server*'s protected
      endpoint: ```[POST] http://127.0.0.1:8090/bookstore/stocklocations/Lyon/9780739360385```
    * However, once more the *Client* is also configured to first obtain clearance for direct
      access. This is why it triggers the OAuth2 dance and forwards your browser to the
      *Authorization Server*'s login page.
    * Login with the credentials ```Curie``` / ```password```.  
      Note that the security is configured to query the BookStore's domain model. The Lyon store has
      an employee "Marie Curie",
      and [the SpEL expression `GlobalStockController`](resource-server/src/main/java/com/baeldung/web/GlobalStockController.java)
      is configured to match OAuth2 principal name against the list of employees for the Lyon store.
    * You will be redirected to the *Client*s proxy endpoint, the *Client* internally performs the
      delegate call and returns the result.
    * The *Resource Server*, upon receipt of the *Client's*
      JWT, [ensures the grantee's name matches the store location](resource-server/src/main/java/com/baeldung/web/GlobalStockController.java): "
      Lyon"
    * The return number, indicating the amount of Harry Potter books in stock in Lyon is now
      augmented by 100.

> Note: Restart the backend or clear your browser's cached cookies when you test the *Client*s
> sequnetially. Otherwise, the *Client* considers you already logged in an attempts to use the wrong
> authorization for delegated access. The *Client*s internal request to the *Resource Server* will
> then be blocked by the security policies in place.
